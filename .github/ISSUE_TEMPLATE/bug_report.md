## üêõ Bug

<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->

### To Reproduce

1. Make sure that the bug can be reproduced with the [BoringModel](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/blob/master/pl_examples/bug_report_model.py).

2. Fill out the test case at the bottom of the BoringModel to make it fail.


#### Code sample
<!-- Ideally attach a minimal code sample to reproduce the decried issue. 
Minimal means having the shortest code but still preserving the bug. -->

### Expected behavior

<!-- A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->
